[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move\
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove\
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing\
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting\
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way\
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

[Chorus]\
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah\
Ah, ah, ah\
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah\
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
I gotta roll, can't stand still\
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill\
Eyes that shine burning red\
Dreams of you all through my head

[Interlude]\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah

[Bridge]\
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby\
Darling, can't you do me now?\
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby\
Move me while you do me now

[Verse 3]\
Take too long 'fore I found out\
What people mean by down and out\
Spent my money, took my car\
Started telling her friend she gonna be a star\
I don't know, but I've been told\
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]\
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah\
Ah, ah, ah\
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah\
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray\
Steady-rollin' woman gonna come my way\
Need a woman gonna hold my hand\
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

[Interlude]\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah, ah, ah, ah\
Ah

[Instrumental Outro]\
Ah\
Ooh, ooh-wah, yeah, oh, yeah, gotta move\
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah\
Gotta move you, now, babe, babe, move, you move, yeah\
Push, push, babe, push, babe, push, babe\
Push it, now, push, baby, push, baby, push, move, move\
Ooh, yeah, ooh, move\
Well, done\
I'm gonna get ya groovin', now, gonna get ya groovin', now
