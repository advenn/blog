## Hello there! I'm Asadbek

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. Here on this blog I share my thoughts the things I do on the job while coding.

I use nickname "adven", "advenn", "advenuz" on the internet, and some people may know me with this name. (btw, in latin "advena" means "stranger", I really like Camus' novel with this name)


### My Journey

I started coding back in 2020 after many years of having interest in coding for years. Since then, I've learnt many technologies, worked over many projects, learnt coding in two languages, created a telegram bot with over 100K users, still learning and doing a lot of cool stuff. 
I self studied python language first, first through "one million uzbek coders" program on udacity, then on [stepik](https://stepik.org/67), then while making telegram bots and finally I learnt a lot of cool stuff at work at [MyTaxi.uz](https://mytaxi.uz)   
You can see detailed info about my professional side on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/advenuz/)
