## Hello there! I'm Asadbek or simply "Bek"

Welcome to my corner of the internet. Here on this blog I share my thoughts the things I do on the job while coding.

I use nickname "adven", "advenn", "advenuz" on the internet, and some people call me with this nick in real life, too (btw, in latin "advena" means "stranger", I really like Camus' novel with this name)


### My Journey

I started coding back in 2020 after many years of having interest in coding for years. Since then, I've learnt many technologies, worked over many projects, learnt coding in two languages, created a telegram bot with over 100K users, still learning and doing a lot of cool stuff. 
I self studied python language first, first through "one million uzbek coders" program on udacity, then on [stepik](https://stepik.org/67), then while making telegram bots and finally I learnt a lot of stuff at work at [MyTaxi.uz](https://mytaxi.uz)
It would be overlooking my work as freelancer, on freelance, I built CRM platform with Django framework for a company to automate their weekly work that takes days, making it done with just some mouse clicks. 
You can see detailed info about my professional side on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/advenuz/) or on my [resume](/files/Qurbonov-Asadbek-resume.pdf)

btw, I started master of science studies on Computer Science in **Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology** from October 2025 and moved to Warsaw.
