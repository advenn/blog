      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beginning&#34;&gt;Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly started freelancing from 2024. At that time I had a client who had accounting/consulting firm, they needed a telegram bot to create template word contracts.
They said they had started doing it but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to finish it themselves. I saw their code, it was on apps script. At that time I first came across with apps script. I made the telegram with aiogram/python.
btw, I used encoding files with base64, docxtpl to render docx files from template.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
